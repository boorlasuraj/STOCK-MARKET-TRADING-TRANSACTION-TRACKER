    "## **INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "**What is our project?**  \n",
    "Our project is a comprehensive system that tracks stock market trading transactions in real time. It is designed to help traders and portfolio managers monitor performance and manage investments effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does it do?**  \n",
    "- **Real-Time Transaction Tracking:** Monitors trading activities as they occur.\n",
    "- **Performance Analysis:** Uses a **Heap** to quickly determine the best (or worst) trading performance metrics.\n",
    "- **Portfolio Management:** Employs an **AVL Tree** to manage and query portfolio data efficiently.\n",
    "- **User Interface:** Provides interactive visualizations and reports on trading performance and portfolio status.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **CONCEPTS USED IN OUR PROJECT**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)**\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:**  \n",
    "  All functionalities—such as transaction tracking, portfolio management, and performance analysis—are encapsulated into separate classes. This modular design makes the system easier to maintain and extend.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Inheritance:**  \n",
    "  Base classes define common attributes and methods for transactions and portfolios, while derived classes add specialized functionalities for different types of trading activities.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Polymorphism:**  \n",
    "  Objects representing various transaction types or portfolio components can be processed uniformly through common interfaces, improving the flexibility and scalability of our system.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Abstraction:**  \n",
    "  Complex operations such as data insertion, deletion, and re-balancing are abstracted away, allowing users to interact with a simplified, user-friendly interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **DATA STRUCTURES USED**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Heap for Tracking Trading Performance**\n",
    "- **What is a Heap?**  \n",
    "  A Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max-heap, every parent node is greater than or equal to its children; in a min-heap, every parent node is less than or equal to its children.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Why Use a Heap?**  \n",
    "  - **Efficiency:** Enables quick insertion and deletion (O(log n)) and rapid access to the top-performing (or worst-performing) trades.\n",
    "  - **Real-Time Updates:** As new transactions occur, the Heap quickly reorders itself, ensuring that performance metrics are always up to date.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### **AVL Tree for Portfolio Management**\n",
    "- **What is an AVL Tree?**  \n",
    "  An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST). In an AVL tree, the difference in heights (balance factor) between the left and right subtrees is kept within a small limit (at most 1). This ensures that the tree remains balanced after each insertion or deletion.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Why Use an AVL Tree?**  \n",
    "  - **Balanced Operations:** Guarantees that search, insertion, and deletion operations remain efficient at O(log n), which is vital for managing a large portfolio.\n",
    "  - **Consistency:** Even with frequent updates, the AVL Tree stays balanced, ensuring that performance remains optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **OUR CLASSES**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TransactionTracker:**  \n",
    "  Manages real-time trading transactions using a Heap to monitor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PortfolioManager:**  \n",
    "  Uses an AVL Tree to store and update portfolio data, enabling fast queries and modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade:**  \n",
    "  Represents individual trading transactions with details such as timestamp, price, volume, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PerformanceMetric:**  \n",
    "  Computes and encapsulates performance indicators for quick comparison via the Heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **ALGORITHM**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Transaction Tracking (Heap):**\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** Add new transaction performance metrics into the Heap.\n",
    "2. **Maintenance:** Reorder the Heap to ensure the best (or worst) performance metric is at the root.\n",
    "3. **Deletion:** Remove outdated or less significant metrics as new data comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Portfolio Management (AVL Tree):**\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** Insert or update a trade record in the AVL Tree.\n",
    "2. **Balancing:** After every insertion or deletion, perform tree rotations to maintain balance.\n",
    "3. **Querying:** Rapidly retrieve and update portfolio information based on stock symbols or timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **IMPLEMENTATION**\n",
    "- **Programming Language:** Python  \n",
    "- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (for interactive demonstration and visualization)  \n",
    "- **Key Libraries:**  \n",
    "  - **heapq:** For Heap operations  \n",
    "  - **Custom AVL Tree Implementation:** For portfolio management  \n",
    "  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For visualizing trading performance and portfolio status  \n",
    "  - **OOP:** The entire system is built using object-oriented design for modularity and maintainability.\n",
